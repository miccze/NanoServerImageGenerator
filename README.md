# Scripts Convert-WindowsImage.ps1 and NanoServerImageGenerator.psm1 are modified Microsoft scripts for optimalization of Nano Server image generation. I have removed unnecessary copying of files to temp location and therefore shortened the time needed for generation of the image. This is especially usefull for Nano Server image generation over network, using files from centralised location on some share.
